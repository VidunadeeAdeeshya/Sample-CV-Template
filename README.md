# Sample-CV-Template
A CV template using HTML and CSS is a webpage that can be used to showcase a person's professional information and qualifications. The template is designed using HTML and CSS, which are both web development languages. The HTML provides the structure and content of the webpage, while the CSS is used to control the layout and styling of the elements on the page.

The template typically includes sections for personal information, education, work experience, skills, and other relevant information. It may also include a section for a photo or headshot, and may be designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes. The template can be easily customized to match a person's unique qualifications and experience, and can be hosted on a website or shared as a link.
